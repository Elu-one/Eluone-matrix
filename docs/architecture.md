# ELULMC Sovereign AGI Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for ELULMC's Sovereign AGI system, designed with security-first principles and infallible loyalty guarantees.

## System Components

### 1. Secure Development Pipeline
- GitHub-based DevSecOps workflow
- Cryptographically signed commits and artifacts
- Multi-stage security validation
- Reproducible builds

### 2. Air-Gapped Training Environment
- Isolated network with no external connectivity
- Controlled data transfer via secure mediums
- Hardware-based security attestation
- Immutable audit logging

### 3. Hardware-Based Secure Inference
- Intel SGX / AMD SEV trusted execution environments
- Encrypted memory and computation
- Remote attestation for integrity verification
- End-to-end encrypted communication

### 4. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Neuro-symbolic architecture integration
- Formal logic verification
- Consistency enforcement
- Interpretable reasoning traces

### 5. Governance and Loyalty Framework
- Constitutional AI alignment
- Multi-layer oversight systems
- Cryptographic access controls
- Continuous monitoring and intervention

## Security Guarantees

1. **Data Confidentiality**: All training data and model weights remain encrypted
2. **Backdoor Prevention**: Formal verification and extensive testing
3. **Leak Detection**: Membership inference and canary token monitoring
4. **Loyalty Assurance**: Constitutional training and runtime enforcement
5. **Audit Trail**: Immutable logging of all operations

## Deployment Architecture

```
[DMZ] -> [Air-Gap Training] -> [Secure Model Store] -> [TEE Inference] -> [Users]
  |              |                      |                    |
[Scan]      [Monitor]              [Encrypt]           [Attest]
```

## Threat Model

- **External Adversaries**: Nation-state actors, corporate espionage
- **Insider Threats**: Malicious employees, compromised accounts
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies, hardware backdoors
- **Model Attacks**: Prompt injection, data extraction, alignment failures

## Compliance Framework

- Zero-trust architecture
- Defense-in-depth security
- Principle of least privilege
- Continuous security validation
