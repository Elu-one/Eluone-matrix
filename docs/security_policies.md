- Loyalty enforcement mechanisms

### SECRET
- Training configurations and hyperparameters
- Performance metrics and evaluation results
- Operational procedures and runbooks
- User interaction logs (anonymized)

### CONFIDENTIAL
- General system architecture
- Non-sensitive code repositories
- Public research references
- Deployment configurations (sanitized)

## Access Control Matrix

| Role | TS-SOVEREIGN | SECRET | CONFIDENTIAL |
|------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| AGI Architect | R/W | R/W | R/W |
| Security Officer | R/W | R/W | R/W |
| ML Engineer | - | R/W | R/W |
| DevOps Engineer | - | R | R/W |
| Auditor | R | R | R |

## Security Controls

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Hardware security keys for privileged access
- Biometric verification for TOP SECRET access
- Regular access reviews and recertification

### Data Handling
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Air-gapped processing for sensitive operations
- Secure deletion procedures for temporary data
- Chain of custody documentation

### Code Security
- All commits must be GPG signed
- Mandatory peer review for all changes
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring

### Operational Security
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Incident response procedures
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
- Security awareness training

## Compliance Requirements

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 Information Security Management
- Common Criteria EAL4+ for critical components
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 for cryptographic modules

## Incident Response

### Classification
- **CRITICAL**: Potential data breach or model compromise
- **HIGH**: Security control failure or unauthorized access
- **MEDIUM**: Policy violation or suspicious activity
- **LOW**: Minor security event or false positive

### Response Procedures
1. Immediate containment and isolation
2. Evidence preservation and forensic analysis
3. Impact assessment and stakeholder notification
4. Remediation and recovery actions
5. Post-incident review and lessons learned

## Audit and Monitoring

- Continuous security monitoring (24/7 SOC)
- Regular compliance audits (quarterly)
- Penetration testing (bi-annually)
- Vulnerability assessments (monthly)
- Security metrics and reporting (weekly)
