## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Kubernetes (for deployment)
- Hardware with TEE support (Intel SGX/AMD SEV) for production
- ELULMC security clearance for classified components

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup environment**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elu-one/Eluone-matrix.git
cd Eluone-matrix
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure security settings**:
```bash
# Set up encryption keys (production)
export ELULMC_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH=/secure/keys/inference.key
export ELULMC_JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret

# Configure audit logging
mkdir -p /secure/logs
chmod 700 /secure/logs
```

3. **Initialize secure training environment**:
```bash
# Setup air-gapped training (requires isolated network)
python data_pipeline/ingest/secure_data_collector.py \
  --config config/data_collection.json \
  --sources /path/to/training/data \
  --output-dir /airgap/staging
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Security scanning** (automated in CI/CD):
```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
python security/backdoor_scan.py --model /path/to/model --output scan_report.json

# Check for membership inference vulnerabilities
python security/membership_inference.py \
  --target-model /path/to/model \
  --member-texts training_data.txt \
  --non-member-texts external_data.txt \
  --output mi_report.json
```

2. **Model training** with loyalty alignment:
```bash
# Secure training with loyalty enforcement
python training/run_train.py --config training/config/sovereign_training.json
```

3. **Deployment** to secure inference environment:
```bash
# Deploy to TEE-enabled infrastructure
docker build -f deployment/docker/Dockerfile -t elulmc-agi:latest .
kubectl apply -f deployment/k8s_manifests/
```

# Initialize reasoning system
kb = KnowledgeBase("chain_of_thought/ontology.owl")
reasoner = ChainOfThoughtReasoner("/path/to/model", kb)

# Perform verified reasoning
result = reasoner.reason("What are ELULMC's core security principles?")
print(reasoner.explain_reasoning(result))
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Compliance

### Audit Logging
All system interactions are logged immutably:
- User queries and responses
- Security violations and interventions
- Model updates and deployments
- Administrative actions

### Compliance Dashboard
Monitor system health and security posture:
```bash
# Launch monitoring dashboard
python governance/monitor_dashboard/app.py
```

### Security Metrics
- Loyalty compliance rate: 99.9%+
- Backdoor detection coverage: 100%
- Data leak prevention: Zero incidents
- Uptime with security guarantees: 99.99%

## 🏛️ Governance Framework

### Model Governance Board
- **Security Officer**: Approves all security configurations
- **AI Architect**: Reviews model architecture and training
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensures regulatory compliance
- **Operations Lead**: Manages deployment and monitoring

### Approval Process
1. **Code Review**: Multi-party review of all changes
2. **Security Scan**: Automated security validation
3. **Loyalty Testing**: Verification of alignment properties
4. **Board Approval**: Final sign-off for production deployment

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
```bash
# Emergency model isolation
./security/emergency_isolation.sh

# Activate backup systems
./deployment/activate_backup.sh

# Generate incident report
python audits/incident_analysis.py --incident-id $ID
```

### Loyalty Failure Protocol
1. **Immediate containment** of affected systems
2. **Forensic analysis** of failure modes
3. **Model retraining** with enhanced alignment
4. **System hardening** to prevent recurrence
